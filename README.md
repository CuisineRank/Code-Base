## Overview
### Description
Application with a database of different foods from different restaurants that will have different ratings given by users so that people can read the comments of the different foods so that they can consume different things when they visit places, foods that they crave and the user can also evaluate the food from 1 to 10 and make comments about the dish.

### App Evaluation
* **Category:** Food/Social Media 
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for mobile.
- **Story:** 
- **Market:** Any individual could choose to use this app, and to keep it a safe environment,use the appropriate vocabulary to comment on the dishes, contact people who have the same interests in dishes or tastes,try new foods and rate them as well as comment what you think or what could be improved, companies can use the ratings to improve in certain aspects and know what things are in style, etc.
- **Habit:** This app could be used as often or unoften as the user wanted depending on how deep they want to know more dishes to try or if they want to get to know more places. 
- **Scope:** 
- First we would start with pairing people based on music taste, then perhaps this could evolve into a music sharing application as well to broaden its usage. Large potential for use with spotify, apple music, or other music streaming applications.
